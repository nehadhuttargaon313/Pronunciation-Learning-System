# Pronunciation-Learning-System
This project is developed using C++/C. It can take a speech sample for 2 seconds, preferably the
words displayed on the screen and display itâ€™s corresponding score matching against a well spoken
therapist voice. Initially it is developed for simple words which can be used as a tutorial for kids.
But it can be expanded further for a bigger area of words. It uses the concepts of the famous Hidden
Markov Model to store the properties of the speech sample and compare the new sample with these
properties to detect which word has been spoken.
